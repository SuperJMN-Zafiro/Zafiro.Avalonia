# Zafiro.Avalonia

This library offers common (and useful) features to AvaloniaUI based applications.

Some of the most important hightligts of the library are:

## Dialogs

A very convenient way to show dialogs for **both** mobile and desktop.

## Notification Service

* Useful service to show notifications from ViewModels.

## Controls

* **MasterDetailsView**. Side list with items. Details are shown when an item is selected.
* **AdaptiveControl**. Has 2 templates: one for portrait and another for landscape.
### WizardControl

Offers a nice way to show wizards (multiple steps).

### **StringEditorControl**

Looks like a TextBlock, but it's editable (and validatable!).

## Misc

* **NamingConventionViewLocator**. A data template that finds views for ViewModels by naming convention (ViewModel => View) AKA "ViewLocator" in AvaloniaUI templates.
* **ReturnExtension**. A markup extension that can be used to return observables in design-time data (as part of Design.PreviewWith).
